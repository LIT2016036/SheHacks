<h1>WATER AND SANITATION</h1>
<p>
<img src="pics of disease/overweight/images.jpg"></img>
Being overweight or fat is having more body fat than is optimally healthy. Being overweight is especially common where food supplies are plentiful and lifestyles are sedentary.
Being overweight is generally caused by the intake of more calories (by eating) than are expended by the body (by exercise and everyday activity). Factors that may contribute to this imbalance include:

Alcoholism
Eating disorders (such as binge eating)
Genetic predisposition
Hormonal imbalances (e.g. hypothyroidism)
Insufficient or poor-quality sleep
Being overweight has been identified as a cause of cancer, and is projected to overtake smoking as the primary cause of cancer in developed countries
