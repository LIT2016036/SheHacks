<h1>STROKE</h1>

Upper respiratory infections (URIs) are one of the most common reasons for doctor visits.
Upper respiratory infections are the most common illness resulting in missed work or school.
Upper respiratory infections can happen at any time, but are most common in the fall and winter.
The vast majority of upper respiratory infections are caused by viruses and are self-limited.
Symptoms of upper respiratory infection include
cough,
sneezing,
nasal discharge,
nasal congestion,
runny nose,
fever,
scratchy or sore throat, and
nasal breathing.
Antibiotics are rarely needed to treat upper respiratory infections and generally should be avoided, unless the doctor suspects a bacterial infection.
Simple techniques, such as, proper hand washing and covering face while coughing or sneezing, may reduce the spread of upper respiratory infections.
General outlook for upper respiratory infections is favorable, although, sometimes complication can occur.
Wikipedia:
Respiratory tract infection (RTI) refers to any of a number of infectious diseases involving the respiratory tract. An infection of this type is normally further classified as an upper respiratory tract infection (URI or URTI) or a lower respiratory tract infection (LRI or LRTI). Lower respiratory infections, such as pneumonia, tend to be far more serious conditions than upper respiratory infections, such as the common cold.
